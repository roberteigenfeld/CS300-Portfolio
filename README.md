# CS300-Portfolio


## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this project, I aimed to create a course planner application that helps manage course data, including course numbers, titles, and prerequisites. I wanted to make it easier for students and advisors to find and organize this information.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by using data structures that could efficiently store and access course information. I used a std::map to hold the course data, which allowed for quick lookups by course number. Understanding data structures is important because they help organize data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and modify.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced some roadblocks during the data parsing phase, especially with malformed input lines that caused issues when loading course data. To overcome this, I added error handling to catch and report any problems, which helped the program handle unexpected input without crashing.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project expanded my approach to designing software by showing me the value of modular design. I created separate functions for loading data, displaying course lists, and printing course details, which made the code easier to manage. I also focused on user-centered design by adding features that enhance the user experience, like input validation and clear feedback.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has changed how I write programs. I focused on making my code more maintainable and readable by using consistent naming conventions and adding comments. I also designed the program with future enhancements in mind, allowing for features like saving modified course data. These practices will help me write cleaner and more effective code in future projects.
